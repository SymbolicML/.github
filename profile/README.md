# SymbolicML

This GitHub Organization is dedicated to machine learning algorithms which operate on symbolic representations.

SymbolicML will eventually house [PySR](https://github.com/MilesCranmer/PySR), [SymbolicRegression.jl](https://github.com/MilesCranmer/SymbolicRegression.jl), and other related packages.

It currently hosts [DynamicExpressions.jl](https://github.com/SymbolicML/DynamicExpressions.jl), which is a framework for building symbolic regression algorithms (and is used by PySR and SymbolicRegression.jl),
as well as [DynamicQuantities.jl](https://github.com/SymbolicML/DynamicQuantities.jl), which is a lightweight package for physical units that offers type stability.
